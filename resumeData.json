When he first arrived he assessed our needs and quickly had a first script running and successfully did a load into a small simple table.  After that he was off and running!  As the work progressed to more complex loads, he has significantly improved his Python coding skills and coding efficiency. His work provides us new functionality for automated entries and error logging that provides enough information to help resolve any errors with the load. The Selenium library he is leaving us with will save hundreds of hours of manual coding. Given the unusual circumstances of this work term, it is a blessing that Andrei is such a strong, self-directed learner as he has been able to continue working from home and making great progress. ",

He has acknowledged what has been expected of him for his term and has delivered his work on time. Andrei asks valuable questions and makes the extra effort to understand the overall functionality of our application and ways in which we can improve our user experience. His work this term will also greatly increase the overall effeciency of our QA process.",
